# Tab Seperator

Getting lost in a sea of tabs is a massive time-waster and will-draining.</br>  
By grouping tabs together; and then to assign working tabs to be 'as part of' these larger groups; I will hope to never get lost in a sea of tabs ever again.</br></br>  
*this is a work in progress*

I want to view all open tabs within a single master index.

As a User,
So that I can organise my browser experience,
I want to group tabs together with seperators.

As a User,
So that I can manage my tabs,
I want to see all active tabs in a drop down menu.  

As a user,
so that I can interact with the extension,
I want to be able to select different tabs to group.
